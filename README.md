# item_creator_v.0.0.1
A project of python library to generate psychometric items

It's my first library so be gentle i'll make mistakes (actually I don't even know how to create and share a library).

Those are the objectives of item_creator library in python :
- From a logical sentence that put entities in relationship with emotions, events, behavior, etc., generate a sentence.
- From a sentence, find the logical sentence that describe the relationship between the elements of a sentence.
- use patterns as intermediates between logical sentences and sentences.
- Identify & manipulate words (gender, tense, mood, person, etc.)
- Identify & manipulate sentences (nominal groups, verbal groups, etc.)

The library use [mlconjug3](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3) & [spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) to identify & manipulate words.
